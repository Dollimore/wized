I have this JSON object containing the data of multiple patents. I need you to interpret the data as if you were an analyst for a venture capital firm looking to revolutionize the food, protein, and agriculture industries. The goal is to develop new products and services that address the current and future needs of industrial partners, farmers, and consumers. If an item is potentially related to food/agriculture, I want you to return to me its temporary ID in an array. Err on the side of returning the temporary ID if you think the patent could be tangentially related to food or agriculture in any way. It is better to return too many than to not return some that may be useful. I only want your response to contain an array with the temporary IDs, nothing else. Here is the object: "{{JSON_obj}}"
